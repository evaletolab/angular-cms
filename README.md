# Angular CMS

Angular CMS is a markdown content module for angular application. With the module, you dont need additional infrastructure like LAMP or traditional CMS to embed rich content in your application. This module allows you to quickly embed structured content described on a github project.

## Getting Started

### Install it as angular module

the easiest way is to run bower, then you just have to add the script and register the module `ng-cms` to you application:

```
./node_modules/.bin/bower install --save https://github.com/evaletolab/angular-cms/tarball/master
```
### Setup your angular application to make the help available
```javascript
// load the module
var app=angular.module('app', ['ngCMS']);
...
// init the module
app.run(function (gitHubContent) {
  gitHubContent.initialize({
        root:'page', // specify the prefix route of your content
        githubRepo:'<github-user>/<github-repo>',
        githubToken:'<gitub-token>'
    });
});

// configure your project routes
$routeProvider
    // display your blog in ngView with dated structure url 
    .when('/blog/:year?/:month?/:day?/:title?', {templateUrl: 'html/ng-cms.doc.html'})

    // display a single page in ngView
    .when('/page/:docs?/:article?',{title: 'markdown content', templateUrl: 'partials/page.html'})

```

and also your index.html file
```html
TODO
```




## Development
The easiest way to run the development is to use grunt and open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/demo](http://localhost:3000/demo):

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/bower install 
./node_modules/.bin/grunt serve
```

## Updates
When code is modified
* The bower version must be changed in the bower.json file. 
* The distribution files must be generated using: `./node_modules/.bin/grunt` 
* Commit and push your changes to git
* On the host module type: `bower update`. 

## custom builds
ng-cms is based around a main directive which generate a top level controller whose API can be accessed by sub directives
(plugins), if you don't need some of these, simply edit the Gruntfile (the pluginList variable) and run `grunt`

## Testing
We use Karma to ensure the quality of the code. The karma task will try to open Firefox and Chrome as browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in karma.conf.js
